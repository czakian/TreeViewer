This is a tree viewer for displaying binary trees.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The java program reads input from the stdin and is expecting a newline
   delimeted input from a preorder traversal. NULL nodes are marked by a newline
   themselves.
   
   Example: 1 \n  \n 2 \n \n 3 \n \n \n will give the tree:
   1
    \
     2
      \
       3

   and: a \n b \n \n c \n \n \n

   	a
       / \
      b   c

2. USAGE:
   This program can be called in any way that gives it input from the stdin;
   however, this method of invoking the application could also be helpful
   
   ./<your program> <optional args> | java Tree
   
   where <your program> outputs a preorder traversal of a binary tree as
   explained in 1.
